As I'd suspected, cries of poor aerodynamics were -at BEST- overblown (as it were).

"@voytechs @Teslarati Do you think theyll turn the cybertruck into an SUV model too? Also, will they turn that into a van? And what about a Tesla made ladderrack for the cybetruck, &amp; a Tesla made truck cap? If they don‚Äôt make and sell those accessories should at least put hard points on the surface."

@Tesla @elonmusk  : what about a snowplough option for #Cybertruck ? :)
"@SimoneGiertz If u had released #Cybertruck under the #shittyrobots model, would have been epic. Missed opportunity @Tesla

took me a good while to figure out what was really going on here. So far in the future it looks like s*** from the past"
@TeslaPodcast I agree. I don't think Elon and tesla even think about branding in general but I thought his take was different and interesting. I think the price point for the cybertruck is equally if not more disruptive than the design itself.
"@elonmusk A truck box unique to the Tesla Cybertruck. Maybe even give the option to forfeit trunk space for a bulky ugly battery. That way if someone doesn‚Äôt need the high towing capacity of the more expensive options, but needs the range they can have it. Oh and lights, lots of em........"

"@YillyYitch @RenataKonkoly @elonmusk @Tesla @Teslarati @InsideEVs i wouldnt be so sure, The grip advantage of a dually, diesel powered pickup, especially with a proper low range 4X4 would just be giving ICE the best shot it has at beating Cybertruck. that's all im saying here imho"
